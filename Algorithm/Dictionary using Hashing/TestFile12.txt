As such, the researchers argue, 
their system captures something of the elasticity of human concepts, 
which often have fuzzy boundaries but still seem to delimit coherent categories. 
It also mimics the human ability to learn new concepts from few examples. 
It thus offers hope, they say, that the type of computational structure it¡¦s built on, 
called a probabilistic program, 
could help model human acquisition of more sophisticated concepts as well.

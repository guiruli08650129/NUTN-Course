says Josh Tenenbaum, a professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive sciences at MIT, 
a principal investigator in the MIT Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, 
and one of the new system・s co-developers. 
：But what・s been lost is that intelligence isn・t just about classifying or recognizing; 
it・s about thinking.；

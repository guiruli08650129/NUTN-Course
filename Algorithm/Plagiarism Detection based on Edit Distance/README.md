Plagiarism Detection based on Edit Distance
Implement "Plagiarism Detection System" by edit distance.

Description
---
1. Implement minimum edit distance by Dynamic Programming.
    - Minimum Edit Distance: 3 operations
        - Insertion, Deletion, and Substitution
    - Levenshtein distance: 4 operations
        - Insertion: 1 operation
        - Deletion: 1 operation
        - Substitution: 2 operations
	- Input: Strings S_1 and S_2 (input by keyboard)
	- Output: Minimum Edit Distance (number) between S_1 and S_2
2. Implement plagiarism detection system by 1. with 2 Minimum Edit Distance.
    - Input: original file(O) and copy file(T) (with read file, consider space, tab, enter and so on...)
	- Output: 
	    - Degree of plagiarism for whole file.
	    - Degree of plagiarism for each paragraph.
	    - Variance of plagiarism for each paragraph.
	    - Standard deviation of plagiarism for each paragraph.

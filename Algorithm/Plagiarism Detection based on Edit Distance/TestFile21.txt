The researchers reported their findings last week at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering.
Joining Rubin on the paper are Martin Rinard, a professor of computer science and engineering at MIT; Michael Gordon, who received his PhD in electrical engineering and computer science in 2010 and remained at CSAIL as a researcher until last July; and Nguyen Nguyen of the engineering firm UWin Software.
Different operations performed by the same mobile app may require outside communication,and rather than try to coordinate shared access to a single communication channel, the app will typically open a separate communication channel for each operation.
